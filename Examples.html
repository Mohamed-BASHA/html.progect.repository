<h4>-Email Spam Filters</h4>
Email spam filters use machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, to learn which emails you don’t want or emails that might be dangerous to land in your inbox and filters them out. But that’s not the only AI activity in your inbox. Google recently introduced an AI-powered service called Smart Reply that creates short email message replies suggestions based on how you have responded to similar messages before.

<h4>-Teslas Learning from Other Teslas</h4>
Even though Elon Musk has ruffled some feathers in the AI world with his strong warnings regarding the negative impacts of the technology, his Tesla vehicles are all connected and can learn from one another. If one car effectively manoeuvres to avoid an obstacle in the road, the rest of the fleet will know how to do the exact same thing once software updates are delivered sharing that data. His team is still working on building a fully autonomous vehicle for our roadways, so AI is very much a part of his operation.

<h4>-Video Games</h4>
Artificial intelligence has been part of video game platforms for years, but now its applications are becoming more sophisticated. In the games series Middle Earth, AI characters evolve based on their interaction with players. Today, any video game you play is powered by AI in some way.

<h4>-Online Ads and Chatbots</h4>
If you think online ads are stalking you now, the technology is only getting more refined. Your actions, searches and activity are monitored online so that AI algorithms can serve up advertisements that are most likely going to resonate with you. This network is so effective that global spending on martech, the digital marketing industry, is expected to exceed $100 billion. Another way AI helps in marketing products and services is through chatbots. Drift, a marketing automation company, uses natural language processing and machine learning with chatbots to help businesses make sales and provide customer service more effectively.

<h4>-Discovering Drugs</h4>
Atomwise, a company that uses AI for drug discovery, illustrates the potential for AI to improve the results of businesses of all kinds. AI is part of the Atomwise team, but there are many humans in the effort including medicinal chemists, structural biologists and machine learning experts. The company is an excellent example of how artificial intelligence technology can augment and accelerate human efforts in the achievement of a goal. In this case, the company is helping provide insight so that medicines to fight some of the world's harshest diseases such as Ebola can be developed faster.  

<h4>-Robots</h4>
AI powers countless robots, including UC Berkely’s BRETT and the infamous MIT dog. An example of an AI-powered robot that’s gained media buzz is Sophia, who chatted and sang (albeit rather robotically) with Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show.

Apart from the pop culture buzz, smart AI robots come in a multitude of shapes and sizes. IRobot’s Roomba 980 vacuum cleaner employs AI to get a sense of the room it will be hovering up, from size to most efficient pattern to sweep the space. Let it go and it does all the work. The company claims that in excess of 10 million Roombas have been sold.

<h4>-Social Networks</h4>
The major social media networks are a core driver of the development of artificial intelligence. Facebook in particular seemingly uses every aspect of AI. For instance, its algorithm defines your timeline, deciding to show or not show certain of your friends’ posts on your timeline. Facebook knows that if everyone of your friends was displayed, your timeline would be so cluttered it would be off-putting. So the timeline algorithm learns who you interact with and who you normally ignore. (So if you want to see more of a friend’s posts, you might want to actually Like it).

Most important (to Facebook’s bottom line), the social network uses AI to help personalize the way it feeds you ads, so it has some measure of relevancy for its ad display. Notice that Facebook allows you to comment on an ad’s relevancy to your timeline; every user comment helps the system learn and become more finely tuned. Facebook and Google have a remarkably high percent of the total online ad market, because of the way they use AI to fine tune the display system.

Also, Facebook uses image recognition AI technology to identify the faces in a photo, so it can invite you to tag it. Not surprisingly, given how important photos are to Facebook, the company has invested heavily in facial recognition technology. That a machine can “read” a photograph is one of the more remarkable advances in the current era of artificial intelligence.
