Before leading to the meaning of artificial intelligence let understand what is the meaning of the Intelligence-

Intelligence: The ability to learn and solve problems. This definition is taken from webster’s Dictionary.

The most common answer that one expects is “to make computers intelligent so that they can act intelligently!”, but the question is how much intelligent? How can one judge the intelligence?

…as intelligent as humans. If the computers can, somehow, solve real-world problems, by improving on their own from the past experiences, they would be called “intelligent”.
Thus, the AI systems are more generic(rather than specific), have the ability to “think” and are more flexible.
Intelligence, as we know, is the ability to acquire and apply the knowledge. Knowledge is the information acquired through experience. 
Experience is the knowledge gained through exposure(training). Summing the terms up, we get artificial intelligence as the “copy of something natural(i.e., human beings) ‘WHO’ is capable of acquiring
and applying the information it has gained through exposure.”

<h3>Intelligence is composed of:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reasoning</li>
<li>Learning</li>
<li>Problem Solving</li>
<li>Perception</li>
<li>Perception</li>
</ul>
Many tools are used in AI, including versions of search and mathematical optimization, logic, methods based on probability and economics. The AI field draws upon computer science, mathematics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuro-science, artificial psychology and many others.

<h3>Need for Artificial Intelligence:</h3>
<ul>
<li>To create expert systems which exhibit intelligent behavior with the capability to learn, demonstrate, explain and advice its users.</li>
<li>Helping machines find solutions to complex problems like humans do and applying them as algorithms in a computer-friendly manner.</li>
